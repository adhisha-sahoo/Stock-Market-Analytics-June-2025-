## üõ¢Ô∏è Section 1: SQL ‚Äì Data Preparation & Analysis

> **Note:** SQL was used for backend data cleaning and analysis, not as a live data source for the Power BI dashboard.

### üî∏ Tools & Source
- **RDBMS:** MySQL 8.0  
- **Data Source:** `stock_market_june2025.csv`  
- **Schema:** Fields include `trade_date`, `ticker`, `close_price`, `volume_traded`, `pe_ratio`, `eps`, `sector`, etc.

### üî∏ Key SQL Operations Performed
- Created a database and table for the stock data
- Handled date conversion from `VARCHAR` to `DATE` using `STR_TO_DATE`
- Loaded the dataset via `LOAD DATA INFILE` (after adjusting secure file privileges)
- Applied analytical queries for:

  - Latest closing prices per ticker
  - Daily % change in price
  - Volatility (high - low)
  - Sector-wise average PE ratio and EPS
  - Top companies by market cap and dividend yield
  - 52-week high/low comparison
  - 7-day average trading volume

### üî∏ Purpose of SQL Layer
- Practice building reporting-ready datasets
- Apply window functions, CTEs, and financial aggregations
- Prepare for integration in future BI pipelines or live connections
